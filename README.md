# Agent Support Automation

Automated customer support for AI agent APIs.

## The Problem

Once you have paying customers, support becomes a bottleneck:
- "How do I reset my API key?"
- "Why was I charged $X?"
- "What's my current usage?"
- "How do I upgrade my plan?"

**Manual support doesn't scale.** You're either coding or answering tickets.

## The Solution

**Self-service support portal** + **AI-powered automated responses** for common queries.

### Core Features

**1. Support Portal (Customer-Facing)**
- API key management (view, rotate, revoke)
- Usage dashboard (real-time metrics)
- Billing history (invoices, payments, refunds)
- Help center (searchable FAQs)

**2. AI Support Agent**
- Natural language query handling
- Auto-categorize tickets (billing, technical, feature request)
- Suggest KB articles
- Escalate to human when needed

**3. Integration**
- Embeds in existing apps (iframe or standalone)
- Stripe webhook integration (billing updates)
- Email notifications (ticket status, resolutions)
- Slack/Discord alerts for escalations
